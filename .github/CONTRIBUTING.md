## Coding conventions

We have no explicit coding standards as we like to support creativity at its highest level. However, in order to sanitize coding standards, please try to keep the code clean and understandable by using a well designed file structure and comments where needed.

## Code of Conduct

This section should explicitly state that we will not discriminate against people on any grounds other than their code contributions, and make clear that behaviour that would be harmful to other people that may wish to contribute is not acceptable. This gives clear authority to remove people who are causing problems, and also sets a clear tone of inclusion.
